Requirements
------------

This plugin requires the spandsp_util source code, and the spandsp library.

See the README file in the spandsp_util for more information on obtaining
the spandsp library and it's dependencies

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

The spandsp_util and spandsp programs are released under the GPL
license. The spandsp_fax plugin is released under the MPL license, which 
is not GPL compatible. 

The intent is that spandsp_fax should invoke spandsp_util to perform
the fax functions, and hence conform to the GPL. Until this happens,
the fax_spandsp plugin is not GPL compliant.
